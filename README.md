# COVID-Web-Scraping-using-Power-BI
### About
In this project, using Covid-19 website for web scraping with the help of Power Query in Power BI. After scraping the data from the website, making an attractive Dashboard for the visualization of the COVID-19 impact. The goal is to provide an automated solution for retrieving up-to-date COVID-19 statistics and generating interactive reports for analysis and visualization.
### Introduction
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for accurate and real-time information about the virus has become crucial. Web scraping is a powerful technique that allows us to extract data from websites and gather the latest COVID-19 statistics from reliable sources.

Scraping website data can be done easily using Power Query in Power BI. This tool has the ability to scrape tabular data from a website. This application will search for a table within in the website and allows us to import it into the data model.

This project combines web scraping with Power BI, a leading business intelligence tool, to automate the process of collecting and visualizing COVID-19 data. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, we can create dynamic dashboards and reports that provide insights into the pandemic's impact.
### Prerequisites
Before begin, ensure that we have the following prerequisite:

* Power BI Desktop
### Step-by-Step Guide

##### Step 11: Design the Dashboard
Arrange the visualizations on the report canvas to create an intuitive and visually appealing layout. Add additional elements like slicers, filters, or text boxes to enhance interactivity and provide context to the COVID-19 data.
##### Step 12: Apply Formatting
Customize the appearance of the visualizations by adjusting colors, fonts, labels, and other formatting options. Use the formatting tools available in Power BI to ensure consistency and improve the visual appeal of our dashboard.
##### Step 13: Monitor and Update
Regularly monitor the COVID-19 data sources and update our dashboard accordingly. Power BI provides options for scheduled data refresh, which can automatically update our dashboard with the latest COVID-19 statistics.
